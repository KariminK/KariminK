        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Currently I am learning how to do client-side routing using React
          Router
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>PSI Site</h3>
            <p>
              It is my very first fullstack site which i built with my friend
              <a href="https://github.com/yuuchiro">yuchiro</a>. On front side,
              it is pure html, css and js. On the backend I've used NodeJS +
              Express with MariaDB (MySQL) database. It was made for open-days
              in our school. Users can log-in or register on site and add posts
              or comment exisiting.
            </p>

            <h3>Shopping cart</h3>
            <p>
              Work-in-progress project which i am doing for
              <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>
              curriculum. It tests my skills in React (especially in client-side
              routing). This site retrieves data from fakewebstore API and
              allows users to add particular products to the cart. They also can
              remove added products from cart.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>ZST Timetable</h3>
            <p>
              It is a project for my school. Basically it is normal timetable,
              but better. It has two parts: frontend (retrieves data from api
              and displays lessons) and backend (it uses
              <a href="https://github.com/wulkanowy/timetable-parser-js">
                data parser
              </a>
              to process data from timetable site generated from school-ejournal
              and sends in response filtered data). This timetable allows
              students to filter lessons by classroom or class-group which
              current site can't do.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>zst++ and phpzst</h3>
            <p>
              They are base for bigger project (basically a documentation for
              all tests to my school). Zst++ is about files in c++. Whereas
              phpzst is about basic class making in php. I kinda wanted to
              finally something quite usefull rather than one more useless
              project. This site is in polish, beacuse it is easier to explain
              things in my native language than in english (Polska gurom).

            <h3>Fikrad and Path of Mushrooms</h3>
            <p>
              They are two educational games made for GEEK competition. First
              one was written in React (I know, strange choice for a game), and
              it is pretty hard logical game with a sprinkling of plot. The
              other one is much less advanced. Basically, it is simple minigame,
              where user using arrows on keyboard collects mushrooms to the
              cart. The game displays info about recently collected mushroom and
              if it's poisonous, you lose one heart, if it's eatable - u gain
              one point. The game ends if you lose all hearts.

            <h3>Other smaller stuff</h3>
            <p>
              I have done a lot of smaller projects, which aren't worth to
              mention here. If you wanna watch them, then I invite you to my
